## About
A proof of concept malware c2 server and client for windows written in rust using an [async](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) structure with custom protocols and tools.

This project is the product of me wanting to learn more about the [windows API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) internals, aswell as how different types of malware operate under the hood, like ransomware and RATs. Using rust was a personal preferance due to its memory-safety, and creating more advanced tools like this was a good way for me to continue learning about it.

You will need rust and cargo installed to build the project


## Usage
To install, clone this repository and run the following:
```powershell
cargo build --release
```
## Running
To run the project in a local environment (meaning you are running malware on yourself, **so be careful**), run the following in powershell:
```powershell
# in the project root
cd target/release
Start-Process -FilePath client.exe -WindowStyle hidden ; ./server.exe
```
information stored by the server is located in the `srv-data` folder, which is created in the directory the server is ran from
